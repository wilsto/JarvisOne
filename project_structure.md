### `data/`

- **Purpose**: Stores data files, embeddings, and other data used by the application, designed to hold any persistent data that JarvisOne needs to operate.

### `docs/`

- **Purpose**: Contains project documentation, meant for all the information about the project that is not code.

  #### `docs/everything.md`

  - **Purpose**: Documentation for the command-line interface (CLI) of JarvisOne, providing information about how to use the CLI, available commands, their options, and overall usage examples.

### `log/`

- **Purpose**: Stores log files generated by the application, holding logs that capture various events, warnings, and errors during the application's runtime.

### `src/`

- **Purpose**: Contains the main source code for JarvisOne, organizing all the Python modules that power the application by functionalities.

  #### `src/core/`

  - **Purpose**: Contains core logic, interfaces, and security implementations, including the fundamental components that the application depends on.

    ##### `src/core/llm_providers/`

    - **Purpose**: Contains specific implementations for different LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT-4, Ollama), handling authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.

    ##### `src/core/interfaces/`

    - **Purpose**: Defines common interfaces and protocols used throughout the application, containing abstract classes or protocols that define how different components should interact with each other.

    ##### `src/core/security/`

    - **Purpose**: Implements input validation and guardrails for security, handling data sanitization and validation and preventing the application from processing malicious or incorrect data.

    ##### `src/core/config_manager.py`

    - **Purpose**: Manages the application's configuration, loading the configurations from the `config.yaml` file, providing access to these configurations, and validating that the configuration is valid.

  #### `src/agents/`

  - **Purpose**: Contains LLM-powered agents to perform specific tasks, orchestrating LLMs and tools to complete a goal.

    ##### `src/agents/file_search_agent.py`

    - **Purpose**: Implements an agent that searches for files based on given criteria, utilizing LLMs and tools to locate files matching specific keywords or patterns within a defined file system.

    ##### `src/agents/query_analyzer_agent.py`

    - **Purpose**: Implements an agent that analyzes user queries, understanding and interpreting user queries, transforming them into structured information or specific instructions for other agents or services.

  #### `src/ui/`

  - **Purpose**: Contains UI components and styling, managing the user interface of the application, with specific files dedicated to reusable elements and page-specific content.

    ##### `src/ui/components/`

    - **Purpose**: Contains reusable UI components, such as buttons, input fields, and other widgets that are reused in multiple places in the application.

    ##### `src/ui/pages/`

    - **Purpose**: Contains page-specific UI components, components that are specific to a certain page in the application (e.g., a login page, settings page).

    ##### `src/ui/styles/`

    - **Purpose**: Contains UI styling, storing CSS rules and style definitions to manage the look and feel of the application.

  #### `src/types/`

  - **Purpose**: Contains custom data types and schemas, storing schemas, data models, and data structures that are used throughout the application.

  #### `src/utils/`

  - **Purpose**: Contains utility modules, holding helpful modules for logging, data transformation, and other common tasks.

    ##### `src/utils/logging_config.py`

    - **Purpose**: Configures logging for the application, initializing the logging system, specifying logging levels, output formats, and more.
